# Fighter-Robot
Robot made using Java and the Becker library that is optimized for fighting other robots. 

The robot versions were made for a collection of Java classes and a different main program that would handle creating the arena, game rules, and overall management of robots.

Through this project, I learned the process of understanding an already established codebase and how to contribute my own code to work alongside it.
